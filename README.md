**Foundational Zig bindings for making games with RayLib**

RayZig is a work in progress aimed at providing foundational Zig bindings to create games using the RayLib library. The goal is to offer a clean, efficient, and idiomatic Zig interface to RayLib's powerful game development features.

## Project Status

This project is currently in the early stages of development. The basic structure and some initial functionality are already in place, including:

- Basic project setup with Zig build system integration.
- RayLib bindings for essential game functions.
- A simple example application that demonstrates window creation and drawing operations.

## Future Plans

- **GitHub Actions**: I plan to integrate continuous testing using GitHub Actions to ensure code quality and reliability as the project evolves.
- **Additional Features**: As the project progresses, more features and utilities will be added to make game development with Zig and RayLib more accessible.

## Getting Started

To get started with RayZig, clone the repository and build the project using Zig:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sposito/RayZig.git
cd RayZig
zig build run
```

This will compile and run a simple example game that opens a window and draws a red circle on the screen.
